## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [ ] [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- [ ] Python [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

### Module installation
To install the Cyberwatch API module, use Python 3 with:

```python
pip3 install cyberwatch_api
```

### Configuration

To be able to authenticate to the Cyberwatch API, you need to configure the api.conf file. This client authenticates using basic auth.

All the information can be retrieved in your profile on the Cyberwatch interface while creating an API user as following:

"Profile > API keys > See my API keys > +Add"

You can download directly the api.conf file after clicking on "Create > Export" or copy/paste the information to an api.conf file in this directory.

### api.conf file location

The library will search for the api.conf file in the current working directory and, if there is none, in its parent directory.

If the api.conf file is located elsewhere, you can specify the path as shown below:

```python
Cyberwatch_Pyhelper(path_to_conf="your/path/to/api.conf/file/")
```

## Ping

Create a ping.py script with the following content inside:

```python
from cyberwatch_api import Cyberwatch_Pyhelper

output = Cyberwatch_Pyhelper().request(
    method="get",
    endpoint="/api/v3/ping"
    )

print(next(output).json())
```

Then to test it, type the following command:

```bash
$ python3 ping.py
```

The output should look like this:
```bash
{"uuid": "1ab2c3de-546f-789g-9f87-6ed5c4b3a210"}
```

Otherwise, check that there are no typing errors in your API_KEY, SECRET_KEY or API_URL in the api.conf file and that your Cyberwatch instance is up.

## Examples

**Run an example script**

1. Choose a script from the examples directory and copy it to your computer

2. Run it with the following command:

```bash
$ python3 your_example_script_file.py
```

## Usage
**Swagger documentation**

Cyberwatch API provides a Swagger documentation.

Using it, you can :
 * Select the action you want to perform in the documentation
 * Update the "method", "endpoint" and parameters ("params") in you script according to the documentation 
 * Add any required logic

Note that the `request` method provided by this module always outputs a generator. This is intended to allow building of high performance scripts. If the request you perform returns a single result and not a list, you will find the result in the first row of this generator.

**Location of the Swagger's documentation**

You can find it while clicking on the </> logo on the top right of the Cyberwatch interface.

**Request body parameters**

When using this API, you need to distinguish between GET/DELETE and POST/PUT methods.

For the GET/DELETE methods you need to use the `params` variable, while for the POST/PUT methods, you need to use the `body_params` variable as follows:
```python
output = Cyberwatch_Pyhelper().request(
    method="get",
    endpoint="/api/v3/assets/servers/{id}",
    params={'id' : 7}
)
```
```python
output = Cyberwatch_Pyhelper().request(
    method="put",
    endpoint="/api/v3/vulnerabilities/servers/{id}",
    body_params={'id' : 7,'description' : "this is a description", "groups":[3,4]}
)
```

## FAQs

**What if I don't want to verify the SSL certificate?**

Error example:


```bash
ssl.SSLCertVerificationError: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: self-signed certificate (_ssl.c:997)
```

Certificate verification can be bypassed with the `verify_ssl` option.

For example, this option was added to the previous ping.py script as follows:

```python
from cyberwatch_api import Cyberwatch_Pyhelper

output = Cyberwatch_Pyhelper().request(
    method="get",
    endpoint="/api/v3/ping",
    verify_ssl=False
    )

print(next(output).json())
```
